##  AI Prompts & Actions
1. Code Cleaning & Optimization:
- Original Task: My CSS file had redundant styles and inconsistent formatting.
    - AI Assistance: ChatGPT helped clean, reorganize, and simplify the CSS by removing unused code, standardizing indentation, and improving variable usage. Resulted in a more readable and efficient stylesheet.
    - Learning Outcome:
      Improved understanding of CSS structure, style reusability, and performance-friendly design practices.
2. UI Enhancements:
- AI Suggestion: Add icons beside navigation links to improve clarity and design consistency. Implemented icons next to “About,” “Projects,” “GitHub,” and “Contact.”
    - Learning Outcome: Gained experience with icon libraries and accessible design improvements.
3. Original Task: Display how long a visitor has been on the site.
- AI Assistance: ChatGPT guided the logic using Date.now() to capture a startTime, a setInterval that updates every second. Also advised separating state (elapsed seconds) from the UI update function for cleaner code.
- Learning Outcome: Improved understanding of time calculations, intervals, and clean UI state updates.
